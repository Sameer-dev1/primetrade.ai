**Key Observation**: Stable assets (e.g., @1, @107) show gains in Extreme Greed; volatile coins (e.g., kPEPE, FARTCOIN) often lose in Greed.

### Hidden Patterns

- **Timing of Closes**: Profitable trades (e.g., @107 in Extreme Greed) were short-term, capturing upward momentum (values >76)
- **Loss Patterns**: FARTCOIN losses in Greed (values ~60-63) involved high initial positions, closed in batches, indicating over-holding
- **Sentiment Bias**: Trades concentrated in Greed/Extreme Greed, missing Fear opportunities (ideal for buying)
- **Coin Risk**: Volatile coins (e.g., FARTCOIN, kPEPE) had frequent small losses, suggesting over-trading
- **Position Sizing**: Larger positions amplified losses (e.g., -508 on 7,265 tokens)

## Insights and Recommendations

1. **Buy in Fear, Sell in Extreme Greed**: Profitable trades occurred during Extreme Greed (values >75). Strategy: Buy during Fear/Extreme Fear (<50) and sell at Extreme Greed peaks to lock gains
2. **Avoid Holding Through Sentiment Shifts**: Losses in Greed (60-75) suggest closing longs when sentiment drops below 70
3. **Risk Management for Volatile Coins**: FARTCOIN and kPEPE showed consistent losses in Greed. Use smaller position sizes and tight stops for volatile assets
4. **Diversify Timing and Assets**: Success in stable assets (@107) during Extreme Greed suggests quick scalps. Test contrarian buys in Fear (<30) for 20-30% returns per cycle
5. **Monitor Sentiment in Real-Time**: Integrate Fear/Greed Index with alerts, combining with technicals (e.g., RSI) to avoid overbought traps
